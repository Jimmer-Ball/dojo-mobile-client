dojo-mobile-client
==================

An example of a the full Dojox.mobile MVC framework for a private API running on a remote Java server stack 
being talked to by a standard dojo specific REST client using JSON.  

Note the code is fully AMD compliant.  The build system doesn't come with the project, instead its bundled
up with the dojo 1.7.2 dependency.  The build gets done via the custom build.xml and it uses shrinksafe.

Why the Dojo dudes don't fully package dojo releases as maven ZIP artifacts I dunno.  It would save me a
load of time, I had to make my own.
